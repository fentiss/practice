Exercise 1 - Hello Terminal!
1. Print your name to the terminal.
echo ‘Apple’
# Apple
2. Clear your terminal after completing #1.
clear
#

Exercise 2 - Navigating the Command Line
1. Set your working directory to the root directory.
cd / && pwd
# /
2. Set your working directory to your home directory using three different commands.
cd ~ && pwd
# ~
cd /Users/$name && pwd
# ~
cd && pwd
# ~
3. Find a folder on your computer using your file and folder browser, and then set your working directory to that folder using the terminal.
cd ~/Desktop && pwd
# ~/Desktop
4. List all of the files and folders in the directory you navigated to in #3.
ls
# 

Exercise 3 - Creation and Inspection
1. Create a new directory called workbench in your home directory.
cd ~ && mkdir Workbench && ls -l
# ...
# drwxr-xr-x   2 apple  staff    64 Mar 17 10:40 Workbench
2. Without changing directories create a file called readme.txt inside of workbench.
touch ~/Workbench/readme.txt && ls ~/Workbench
# readme.txt
3. Append the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to readme.txt so that each number appears on its own line.
cd ~/Workbench && echo 1 >> readme.txt && echo 2 >> readme.txt && echo 3 >> readme.txt && cat readme.txt
4. Print readme.txt to the command line.
head readme.txt
# 1
# 2
# 3
5. Use output redirection to create a new file in the workbench directory called list.txt which lists the files and folders in your home directory.
ls ~ > ~/Workbench/list.txt && cat ~/Workbench/list.txt
# Applications
# Desktop
# Documents
# Downloads
# Library
# Movies
# Music
# Pictures
# Public
# Workbench
6. Find out how many characters are in list.txt without opening the file or printing it to the command line.
wc ~/Workbench/list.txt
#       13      15     126 ~/Workbench/list.txt
# I edited list.txt in answer #5.

Exercise 4 - Migration and Destruction
1. Create a file called message.txt in your home directory and move it into another directory.
touch message.txt && mv message.txt ~/Desktop && ls ~/Desktop
2. Copy the message.txt you just moved away from your home directory back into your home directory.
cp ~/Desktop/message.txt ~ && ls
# Applications		Downloads	Movies		Pictures	Library
# Desktop		Music		Public		message.txt	Documents
3. Delete both copies of message.txt. Try to do this without using rm.
mv ~/message.txt ~/Desktop/message.txt ~/.Trash && ls ~/.Trash
# message.txt
